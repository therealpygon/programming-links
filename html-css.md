## Intermediate Challenges
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?sort=difficulty|asc&types=free - Similar to frontendpractice -- ranges from beginner to advanced.
https://100dayscss.com/days/1/ - 100 challenges; can start from day 1
https://www.frontendpractice.com/#projects - learn to implement specific details like drop down menus, sticky headers, etc.

## Advanced Challenges
https://www.codewell.cc/challenges - More comprehensive "Implement this site design" challenges.
https://www.dailyui.co/ - An email daily with a new UI to implement. This person's github (https://github.com/haiiro-io/dailyui) has solutions as well as the the designs. The designs include any assets, an animated gif of what to create and a .sketch file ($9/mo subscription for https://www.sketch.com but it is not required)
https://codepen.io/challenges/ -- Click the month's theme title (e.g. "Light :bulb:" to see the weekly challenges). You can also view previous months challenges as well. Much more create-your-own-answer rather than instructional. Basically, there is no "right" or "wrong" answer. 

## Paid stuff but can still be cheap:
https://50projects50days.com/ - this is a paid course, but they also put the solutions on their github at https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days so it would be possible to do for free, you simply wouldn't have the guided challenges.
https://frontloops.io/ - Each course is $19 for lifetime access; I have not tried so I can't talk to whether they are any different than what you can get from free courses. "elements" challenges are to design a responsive element, and  "markup" are more entire page layouts. If you want to be cheap, you could use this persons "results" github (https://github.com/zathio/frontloops-challenges) as it include the design documents and elements they provide.
