# Beginner Learning

Either the odin project or freecodecamp are the best place to start learning. The odinproject actually uses freecodecamp for some parts of their courses

https://www.theodinproject.com/
https://www.freecodecamp.org/

# Beginner Practice Challenges
https://codier.io/

# Intermediate Learning
https://cssgrid.io/ - Deeper dive on CSS Grid
https://flexbox.io/ - Deeper dive on flexbox

**Note:** If you haven't already, you should really have learned javascript for web development at this point as challenges are increasingly likely to require that you implement some javascript to make various things work. Again, refer back to theodenproject/freecodecamp.

# Intermediate/Advanced Challenges
https://100dayscss.com/days/1/ - 100 challenges; can start from day 1
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?sort=difficulty|asc&types=free - Provides entire designs to implement. Ranges from beginner to advanced.
https://www.frontendpractice.com/#projects - Learn to implement specific details like drop down menus, sticky headers, etc by copying other websites.
https://www.codewell.cc/challenges - More comprehensive "Implement this site design" challenges.
https://www.dailyui.co/ - An email daily with a new UI to implement. [This person's github](https://github.com/haiiro-io/dailyui) has solutions as well as the the designs. The designs include any assets, an animated gif of what to create and a .sketch file ($9/mo subscription for [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) but it is not required)
https://codepen.io/challenges/ -- Click the month's theme title (e.g. "Light :bulb:" to see the weekly challenges). You can also view previous months challenges as well. Much more create-your-own-answer rather than instructional. Basically, there is no "right" or "wrong" answer. 

# Self-teaching
[dribble](https://dribbble.com/) - This site has tons of professional designs that can serve for inspiration in coming up with your own website designs to implement.

# Paid stuff but can still be cheap:
https://50projects50days.com/ - this is a paid course, but they also put the solutions [on their github](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days) so it would be possible to do for free, you simply wouldn't have the guided challenges. This will often go on sale for around $15 and is worth it as both Brad Traversy and Florin Pop are great.
https://frontloops.io/ - Each course is $19 for lifetime access; I have not tried so I can't talk to whether they are any different than what you can get from free courses. "elements" challenges are to design a responsive element, and  "markup" are more entire page layouts. If you want to be cheap, you could use [this persons "results" github](https://github.com/zathio/frontloops-challenges) as it include the design documents and elements they provide.
