# Links to various resources for learning Programming/Development

## General 
Links I just find to be useful in general or don't fit into a category.
* [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) - Like a cheatsheet of cheatsheets for various languages.
* [Build Your Own X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) - Tons of links to resources on how to build various types of things.
* [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) - Basically roadmaps of "what should you learn" to become good at the specified thing.
* [Addy Codes Toolkit](https://toolkit.addy.codes) - Repository of web development tools/links/etc.
* [Freecodecamp Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) - It's hard not to find a good course on just about any programming subject.

## Web Development
* [HTML/CSS](./html-css.md)
* [JavaScript](./javascript.md) - JavaScript specific links
